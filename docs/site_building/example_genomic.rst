Setup of an Example Site

The following tutorial will walk you through creating content and loading genomic data. This is a good introduction to Tripal v4.x Content Types and the new Administrative User Interface regardless of whether you intend to store genomic data in your particular Tripal v4 site. This demonstration uses three extension modules: Tripal Analysis Blast, Tripal Analysis KEGG, and Tripal Analysis InterPro.

.. note::

As a rule, extension modules are not documented in the Tripal Userâ€™s Guide. You can find documentation for extension modules that enhance Tripal functionality on the Extension Modules page. However, to provide a functioning demonstration the three analysis extension modules are described here.
