User Permissions
================

.. warning::

  These docs are still being developed. In the future this page will contain a
  very short introduction to user management in Drupal and practical examples
  for site administration of a Tripal site.

.. hint::

  *Hint for contributing to documentation.*

  Use the information from `Official Drupal Docs: What are Users, Roles, and Permissions? <https://www.drupal.org/docs/user_guide/en/user-concept.html>`_
  to breifly summarize what a user, role and permission is, with a focus on
  managing biological data. For example, users and permissions allow you to
  give certain researchers access to private data, roles can help you setup
  groups of collaborators so you can assign the permission to the group as a
  whole which makes it easier if any one member leavers or joins the group.

Creating Roles to enable Curation
------------------------------------

.. hint::

  *Hint for contributing to documentation.*

  Walk admin through creating one or more "Curator" roles based on their needs
  and then assign these roles permissions in Tripal. For example, a curator of
  genomic data would need access to specific importers and content types.

Creating Roles to define collaborative groups
------------------------------------------------

.. hint::

  *Hint for contributing to documentation.*

  Walk admin through the idea of creating roles which focus on specific grants
  or publications. This way and draft or private pages being created related to
  those projects cab be made available to the group for proof reading and collaboration
  before they are made public.

  Walk the admin through assigning permissions / visibility to specific content pages.
  Currently this requires an additional Drupal module: https://www.drupal.org/project/permissions_by_term
  so use this module in your example including screenshots.
